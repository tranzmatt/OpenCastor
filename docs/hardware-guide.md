## 🔍 Auto-Detection (v2026.3.11.0+)

OpenCastor can identify 12+ hardware types automatically — no manual port config needed.

```bash
castor scan
```

`castor scan` detects USB cameras, depth cameras (OAK-D, RealSense), NPU accelerators (Hailo-8, Coral), LiDAR sensors, I²C devices (PCA9685, MPU-6050, BNO055), serial devices (Arduino, Dynamixel U2D2, Feetech CH340), Pollen Robotics Reachy robots (mDNS), and more — then suggests the matching RCAN profile.

## 🔍 Identifying Your Hardware's Driver Protocol

Different hardware uses different communication protocols. Match your hardware
to the right OpenCastor driver.

### Protocol Identification Guide

#### 1. PCA9685 (I2C PWM Controller)
**What it looks like:** A small green/blue breakout board with 16 servo headers,
labeled "PCA9685" or "Adafruit 16-Channel PWM."

**How to verify:**
```bash
# On Raspberry Pi with I2C enabled:
i2cdetect -y 1
# Look for 0x40 (or 0x41-0x7F for shifted addresses)
```

**Used by:** Waveshare AlphaBot, Adeept, Freenove, Yahboom ROSMASTER, SunFounder PiCar

**Preset setting:**
```yaml
drivers:
  - id: "motor_driver"
    protocol: "pca9685_i2c"
    port: "/dev/i2c-1"
    address: "0x40"
    frequency: 50
```

#### 2. Arduino Serial (USB CDC / UART)
**What it looks like:** Arduino Uno (blue, USB-B port), Nano (mini, micro-USB),
or clone board with CH340 USB chip (look for small 8-pin chip near USB port).

**How to verify:**
```bash
ls /dev/ttyACM*    # Genuine Arduino (ATmega16U2 USB chip)
ls /dev/ttyUSB*    # Clone Arduino (CH340 chip)
# After plugging in: dmesg | tail -20
```

**Protocol variants:**
- `arduino_serial_json` — OpenCastor custom firmware (JSON commands)
- `makeblock_serial` — Makeblock proprietary protocol
- `elegoo_serial` — Elegoo firmware protocol

#### 3. EV3dev (LEGO Mindstorms EV3)
**What it looks like:** The large LEGO EV3 brick running ev3dev Linux OS.

**How to verify:**
```bash
ssh robot@ev3dev.local   # Default password: maker
ls /sys/class/tacho-motor/  # Should list motor0, motor1...
ls /sys/class/lego-sensor/  # Should list sensor0, sensor1...
```

#### 4. VEX IQ Serial
**What it looks like:** The VEX IQ Brain box (grey/white) with smart ports.

**How to verify:** Connect via USB; appears as `/dev/ttyACM0`. Run VEXcode to
check firmware version before switching to OpenCastor serial mode.

#### 5. WebSocket / REST (ESP32 WiFi)
**What it looks like:** An ESP32 dev board connected to motor driver(s) with
a WiFi antenna.

**How to verify:** Flash the ESP32 firmware and check its serial output for an IP
address, then: `curl http://<ip>/status`

#### 6. SPIKE Hub Serial (LEGO SPIKE Prime)
**What it looks like:** The LEGO SPIKE Prime hub (white/teal, USB-C port).

**How to verify:** Connect via USB-C; appears as `/dev/ttyACM0`. Run `screen
/dev/ttyACM0 115200` and press Enter — you should see a Python REPL prompt.

## 🔌 Wiring Cheatsheet

### PCA9685 (I2C PWM Controller)

The PCA9685 is the most common motor/servo controller in RPi robot kits.

```
Raspberry Pi → PCA9685 Board
─────────────────────────────
Pin 1  (3.3V)   → VCC
Pin 3  (SDA)    → SDA
Pin 5  (SCL)    → SCL
Pin 6  (GND)    → GND

PCA9685 V+ → External 5-6V power supply (for servos)
           → Or 12V for DC motors via motor driver hat

⚠️  NEVER power motors from the Pi's 5V pin — it will crash the Pi.
    Always use an external supply for motors.
```

**Channel assignment (typical):**
```
Channel 0  → Left front motor (or M1)
Channel 1  → Left rear motor  (or M2)
Channel 2  → Right front motor (or M3)
Channel 3  → Right rear motor  (or M4)
Channel 8  → Camera pan servo
Channel 9  → Camera tilt servo
```

**Frequency:** Use 50 Hz for servos, 200-1000 Hz for DC motors (check your driver IC specs).

**I2C Address:** Default 0x40. If multiple PCA9685 boards, use A0-A5 solder jumpers to change address.

### L298N Dual H-Bridge

The L298N is the classic DC motor driver. Red or blue module, two large screw-terminal blocks.

```
Arduino (Uno/Nano)  →  L298N Module
────────────────────────────────────
Pin 5  (PWM)  → ENA    (left motor speed)
Pin 6  (D)    → IN1    (left motor dir A)
Pin 7  (D)    → IN2    (left motor dir B)
Pin 8  (D)    → IN3    (right motor dir A)
Pin 9  (D)    → IN4    (right motor dir B)
Pin 10 (PWM)  → ENB    (right motor speed)
GND           → GND

External Power → L298N
───────────────────────
7-12V Battery+  → L298N VCC (+12V screw terminal)
Battery-        → L298N GND
                  L298N 5V output → Arduino 5V (ONLY if jumper is present on L298N)

Motors → L298N
──────────────
Motor A: Left  → OUT1 and OUT2
Motor B: Right → OUT3 and OUT4

⚠️  Remove the 5V jumper on L298N if supplying >12V — the onboard regulator
    will overheat. Power Arduino from USB instead.
```

**Logic table:**
```
Forward:   IN1=HIGH, IN2=LOW,  IN3=HIGH, IN4=LOW,  ENA=PWM, ENB=PWM
Backward:  IN1=LOW,  IN2=HIGH, IN3=LOW,  IN4=HIGH, ENA=PWM, ENB=PWM
Left turn: IN1=LOW,  IN2=HIGH, IN3=HIGH, IN4=LOW,  ENA=PWM, ENB=PWM
Right turn:IN1=HIGH, IN2=LOW,  IN3=LOW,  IN4=HIGH, ENA=PWM, ENB=PWM
Stop:      ENA=LOW,  ENB=LOW
```

---

### GPIO Direct Drive

For small motors driven directly from GPIO (only possible with DRV8833/TB6612 breakouts
wired to GPIO pins, NOT raw GPIO — GPIO can't source enough current for motors).

```
Raspberry Pi GPIO → TB6612FNG Breakout
───────────────────────────────────────
GPIO 17 → AIN1   (left dir)
GPIO 27 → AIN2   (left dir)
GPIO 18 → PWMA   (left speed — must be PWM-capable pin)
GPIO 22 → BIN1   (right dir)
GPIO 23 → BIN2   (right dir)
GPIO 13 → PWMB   (right speed — must be PWM-capable pin)
3.3V    → VCC    (logic power)
GND     → GND, STBY tied HIGH

External 5V → VM  (motor power — separate from logic)
```

**RPi BCM PWM pins:** GPIO 12, 13, 18, 19 are hardware PWM. Others are software PWM
(less precise, more CPU use, OK for most robots).

**DRV8833 vs TB6612FNG vs L298N:**
```
Driver    | Max Current | Voltage | Efficiency | Notes
──────────┼─────────────┼─────────┼────────────┼──────────────────────────
L298N     | 2A (3A peak)| 5-46V   | ~70%       | Hot, simple, ubiquitous
TB6612FNG | 1.2A (3A pk)| 2.5-13V | ~95%       | Compact, cool, preferred
DRV8833   | 1.5A (2A pk)| 2.7-10V | ~95%       | Tiny, cheap, great for small bots
L293D     | 600mA       | 4.5-36V | ~60%       | Old DIP IC, very common at makerspaces
```

## 🧪 Testing with `castor test-hardware`

Before running autonomy, always verify your hardware manually.

### Basic Test Sequence

```bash
# 1. Run the guided hardware test (interactive prompts)
castor test-hardware --config my_robot.rcan.yaml

# 2. Run the same full sequence non-interactively
castor test-hardware --config my_robot.rcan.yaml -y

# 3. If movement looks good, start the runtime
castor run --config my_robot.rcan.yaml
```

### What to Look For

**Motors:**
- ✅ Both wheels spin in the correct direction
- ✅ Speed varies proportionally with PWM value
- ❌ Motor doesn't move → Check wiring, PWM pins, power supply voltage
- ❌ Motor spins wrong direction → Set `polarity: -1` in preset or swap motor wires

**Sensors:**
- ✅ Ultrasonic returns plausible distances (5-300 cm)
- ✅ Touch/bumper registers when pressed
- ❌ Sensor returns garbage → Check baud rate, pin assignments
- ❌ I2C sensor not found → Run `i2cdetect -y 1` to find actual address

**Serial connection:**
```bash
# Check device is visible
ls /dev/ttyACM* /dev/ttyUSB*

# Check permissions (Linux)
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER  # Then log out and back in
# Or: sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0  (temporary)

# Monitor raw serial
screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200   # Ctrl+A then K to quit
# Or:
python3 -m serial.tools.miniterm /dev/ttyACM0 115200
```

### I2C Debugging

```bash
# Install i2c-tools
sudo apt install i2c-tools

# Scan for I2C devices
i2cdetect -y 1     # Raspberry Pi I2C bus 1

# Common addresses:
# 0x40 → PCA9685
# 0x68 → MPU6050 IMU
# 0x3C → SSD1306 OLED
# 0x48 → ADS1115 ADC
```

## 🔧 Common Issues & Fixes

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Robot drives in circles | One motor reversed | Set `polarity: -1` for that motor in YAML |
| Motors barely move | Deadband too low | Increase `deadband_pwm` value |
| Robot lurches then stops | Battery voltage drop | Charge battery; add capacitor across motor terminals |
| Serial port not found | Permission denied | `sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER` |
| Serial port not found | Wrong port | `ls /dev/tty*` before and after plugging in |
| Arduino upload fails | Wrong board selected | Try "ATmega328P (Old Bootloader)" for clones |
| I2C nothing at 0x40 | I2C not enabled | `sudo raspi-config` → Interfaces → I2C |
| EV3 not reachable | ev3dev not flashed | Flash ev3dev to microSD; USB RNDIS auto-IP |
| ESP32 won't connect | Wrong IP | Check ESP32 serial output for assigned IP |
| LEGO motor not detected | Loose port | Push cable in until it clicks |
| VEX IQ motor not detected | Dead smart port | Try another port; ports are interchangeable |
