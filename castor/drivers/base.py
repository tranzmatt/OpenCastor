    Subclasses must implement ``_move()`` (preferred), ``stop()``, and ``close()``.

    in that case ``_move()`` is never called and SafetyLayer routing is bypassed.

    SafetyLayer integration
    -----------------------
    Attach a SafetyLayer via ``set_safety_layer(layer)`` (typically done at
    runtime startup via ``wire_drivers_to_safety()``).  Once set, every call to
    ``move()`` is validated by ``safety_layer.write("/dev/motor/cmd", …)`` before
    the command reaches hardware.  Drivers that override ``move()`` directly do
    not receive this automatic routing — migrate them to ``_move()`` to opt in.

    When the underlying hardware SDK is unavailable, drivers should degrade
    gracefully to a mock/logging mode rather than raising import errors.
