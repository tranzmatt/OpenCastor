"""
OpenCastor RCAN Protocol Implementation.

Provides RURI addressing, RCANMessage envelopes, RBAC roles,
JWT authentication, mDNS discovery, capability routing, and
message dispatching per the RCAN protocol specification.

The ``rcan_protocol`` section is required in every ``.rcan.yaml``
config for safety invariants, RURI identity, RBAC, and capability
declaration.  Individual features like mDNS and JWT remain opt-in
within that section.
